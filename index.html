            We play fun, original arrangements of well-known tunes from classic children's films, TV themes, Disney,
            nursery rhymes and more.
            From swing to salsa to samba, funk, ska and reggae!</p>

          <p>Our music is appealing to all ages and we can adapt our set and our band to suit the occasion.
            Get ready to tap your feet to songs from <em>The Jungle Book</em> and <em>Mary Poppins</em>, cartoons such
            as <em>Popeye</em> and <em>Top Cat</em>,
            and retro TV themes including <em>Bewitched</em> and <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>.
            Other favourites include songs from childhood films like <em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em>,

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                The Alley Cats grew out of a band that was put together to play at the East Anglia Children’s Hospice in
                Milton.
                It was a great success, and so the idea for a family-friendly band playing much-loved songs from films
                and TV was born.
                We are proud to continue supporting EACH when we can.
              </p>


              <p>
                The band is led by Vicki Kenny, who is a music therapist, educator and jazz musician. She has worked for
                many years with children teaching jazz and improvisation. Her passion is music and performing,and
                introducing jazz to a younger audience.
              </p>


              <p>
                We have performed in and around Cambridge, at a number of family events, festivals and jazz venues.
                Highlights include the 2019 Cambridge International Jazz Festival, Cambridge City Council's annual
                Mayor's Day Out, and the Cambridge Jazz and Brass in the Parks programme with special guest and BBC
                multi award-winning Saxophonist, Alan Barnes.
              </p>


              <p>
                With an eye to the future, the band are excited to be able to work with top trombonist Dennis Rollins
                MBE at this year's 2019 Cambridge International Jazz Festival.
              </p>

              <h3>Jane Hollingworth &mdash; percussion</h3>
              <p>Jane Hollingworth learned to play drums from the age of 38 and has been playing ever since. She has led
                Brazilian and
                Haitian drum workshops since 1994 and plays congas, jazz drum kit and lately, trombone.</p>

                  href="https://www.irokoband.co.uk">Iroko</a>, and for several other jazz bands in Cambridge and
                Colchester, including
                <em>Blue Town</em>, <em>Jazz Galore</em>, <em>Brass Rose</em> and <em>Cambridge 251</em>. She plays
                trombone for the Norwich-based <em> Vibe City Street Brass </em> and for a big band in Cambridge, but
                her first love has always been congas. She loves Brazilian music &mdash; all
                Brazilian music &mdash; but particularly the ritual rhythms of the African diaspora. She has spent at
                least a month every year
                in Brazil for the past decade, sometimes working with music teachers in schools in the poorer areas of
                Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
