              <h3>Jane Hollingworth &mdash; percussion</h3>
              <p>Jane Hollingworth learned to play drums from the age of 38 and has been playing ever since. She has led
                Brazilian and
                Haitian drum workshops since 1994 and plays congas, jazz drum kit and lately, trombone.</p>

              <p>Besides the Alley Cats, Jane plays drums in her afrobeat band, <a
                  href="https://www.irokoband.co.uk">Iroko</a>, and for several other jazz bands in Cambridge and
                Colchester, including
                <em>Blue Town</em>, <em>Jazz Galore</em>, <em>Brass Rose</em> and <em>Cambridge 251</em>. She plays
                trombone for the Norwich-based <em> Vibe City Street Brass </em> and for a big band in Cambridge, but
                her first love has always been congas. She loves Brazilian music &mdash; all
                Brazilian music &mdash; but particularly the ritual rhythms of the African diaspora. She has spent at
                least a month every year
                in Brazil for the past decade, sometimes working with music teachers in schools in the poorer areas of
                Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

              <p>She regularly performs in many Cambridge venues with a wide range of jazz musicians. She has fronted

              <p>Paul was fourteen when he had his first professional engagement &mdash; a
                dance band performance at (what is now known as) Watford Colosseum.
                It was a long gig; it finished when he was fifteen, just after midnight!
                Since then, he has survived a three-decade career of small-group jazz,
                big bands, shows and pop functions.</p>
              <p>Notably, he made a live TV appearance on Channel 4's '<em>The Big Breakfast</em>'
                (on the day Jeffrey Archer was imprisoned for perjury!)
                A fluent improviser, his influences include Freddie Hubbard, Miles Davis
                and Willy Wonka&hellip; all of whom he thinks of as 'pure imagination'.</p>
